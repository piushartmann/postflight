"""Dispatcher side of the queue: hand jobs out, take results back.

The database belongs to the dispatcher alone. A worker never opens it: it asks for
a job over HTTP, receives a **self-contained spec**, and posts back the facts it
measured. That is what lets a worker run on another machine, and it is why the
spec carries the resolved template rather than a template id, and file *paths*
rather than database ids.

Paths in a spec stay relative to `data_dir`, the same convention the database
already uses (see `paths.py`). Each side resolves them against its own data
directory, so the very same spec works whether the worker shares the dispatcher's
volume or keeps a copy in its own.

Two rules hold the whole thing together:

- **Attribution is atomic.** A conditional `UPDATE ... WHERE state='queued'` is
  what makes a job go to exactly one worker. A read followed by a write would hand
  the same job to two machines that both start decoding.
- **A job is held on a lease.** The worker renews it while it works, and a lease
  nobody renews goes back into the queue. That is what makes a worker one can
  simply switch off, which is the point of the whole exercise.
