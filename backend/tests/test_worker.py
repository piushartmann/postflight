"""The worker's half of the lease: notice when the job stops being ours, and stop.

Fencing is the subtle part. A worker that keeps encoding after losing its lease
races the machine the job was requeued to, and both write the same output file. So
these tests drive the heartbeat with a fake dispatcher and check that the worker
gives up in each of the ways it can lose a job.
