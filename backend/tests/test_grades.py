"""Several looks on one clip, side by side.

A grade became a level of the hierarchy on 2026-08-25: rush, sequence, profile, grade.
What that changes is not the tuning, it is the bookkeeping around it. A clip holds as
many grades as one wants, each named, each with its own file; they are addressed by
name so copying a look twenty times is idempotent; and the clip's measurement is taken
once for all of them.
